  blurb: Since I became a member a few months ago I feel like I have found a community that fits my personality and the type of people I like to associate with. I have a group of friends I game with but after playing with the Dads I feel like we all relate well. It's not a toxic community like some and I love to contribute where I can. I have a passion for certain games and being involved in a community of like minded people and parents makes me feel right at home. I appreciate everything this community is and I look forward to contributing more to it in the future. I am applying to be a streamer for with the Dads because I want to show the viewers and the other Dads my play style and get more involved as well.

  blurb: "Dads Gaming is a community of other gamers that also have lives.  Members understand that family comes first and are here to help support each other if possible and have a friendly place to converse about family and gaming.  Allows us to find other family oriented gamers and get together to play without having to deal with the many immature people you run across when playing with randoms.  Besides just gaming though its a community where you can swap ideas, family stories, vent your frustrations as a dad and all that comes with it."

  blurb: "Dad's Gaming has meant a lot of things over the years. This group of guys no matter the game come out in full support. The PS4 Destiny group has become a group of guys that I can just about call best buds. I've met a good amount of Dad's that are also reservists in the military like myself or are veterans which makes this a good home for me. I love the charity portion of Dad's Gaming as well with OSD and Extra Life. If I ever meet a Dad Gamer, I always try to send him to Dad's Gaming. Knowing full well that he'll be taken care of and meet tons of good people."

  blurb: Dads Gaming is a great community where dads can come together with others who understand the demands of parenthood and share in their love for gaming. It's a safe place where you can discuss things about everyday adult life (work, family, etc.) as well as lose yourself in video games with other dads.

  blurb: Dads Gaming is a community of gamers that are Dads. We can come together with the understanding that being a Dad/Husband to our families is the more important than gaming itself. So when we have time to play, we are able to play with people that don't get upset at one another for having to go take care of errand for the wife or change a poop diaper. This "understanding" enables a positive and enjoyable atmosphere where relationships can be built while doing a hobby that we love. Since I have been with Dads Gaming, I have also learned that we are an outreach group to support charities. I love the community aspect of what Dads Gaming is working towards. It creates an additional purpose to be a part of such a great community. I am glad to be a part of Dads Gaming.

  blurb: Ever since I got married and now have kids my gaming time is limited. So one day i was on Reddit and wondered, if they every sub you can think of. What if they have a sub for dads that are gamers? And sure enough I found dadsgaming. From there I lurked for a while and followed Reno on Twitter and just kept low for a while. Then slowly but surely I met Shawn, Paul, Steve and many more dads. So what really drew me is that they are all like me! Family first then games. I could go on and on about how great this community is.

  blurb: "It's being part of a group that understand what it's like to be a Dad and how special that is. Add in how passionate we are about gaming and we have a great community that aren't toxic or full of negativity, but instead those who understand each other and work to help each other. We don't judge or complain about someone leaving a group to check on our kids or if something comes up in the middle of a raid.

I am so glad I found this group and love teaming up with everyone on playing whatever. Thank you for accepting me into the group and I would love to help out, when I can, with streaming, videos, writing or whatever."

  blurb: I've heard a lot about you guys on several Destiny related podcasts. And during a (waaaaay too long) challenge mode mission in The Division a member of your communtity explained how he was in a group of awesom laidback people called Dadsgaming. That's what gave me the final push, I want to be part of this.

  blurb: The lack of friends to game with.  Seems I can never progress in games.  I've see also a lot of good things posted on Twitter by this community.

  blurb: New to the Channel but I love the concept of Dads who don't get enough hours in the week to game but when they do they help each other out in a fun community to still compete.  It inspired me to do some videos and this is where my strengths are. I have a video editing background and the channel that I started focuses more on an instructional approach. I can stream also but don't do it often.

  blurb: Honestly, Dads Gaming has made playing video games so much more enjoyable.  For too long I have felt alone in my passion for gaming.  Even with the industry being what it is, in my network of friends, family, and business associates, being a video game player is the same as saying you're a lazy hermit. That you live in the basement of your moms house at 40 years old.  That is so not the truth!  I am married to a beautiful woman and have an awesome little boy that I have the privilege to accompany through life and help guide the decisions he makes.  I have a successful career that takes at least 40+ hours of my week and then time with family is most important.  To have a community of like minded adults to share my passion of gaming with has been my saving grace... Also, to have so many on so many different games and so many different systems I am never left alone to game with the pubs!...

  blurb: As a single guy, even as a married guy, my free time was mainly spent playing video games with friends. Mostly my single friends. So when I got married, that changed a little bit because now my time was also my wife's time. Then we had a baby... It then changed again 100%. It's hard to play with my single friends who don't understand the obligations of being both a husband, AND a father. Being a part of Dads means that I've got access to like minded men who know what it's like to be a dad first, and a gamer second. The community is always active, and if I ever need someone to hop in a raid or a nightfall, someone is there.
