  bio: "Progenitor of Dads Gaming. A dad of 2 and since I was 8 yrs old, gaming has been part of my life and never looked back. For me, playing with Dads Gaming is like the ultimate online couch co-op experience. Offline, I enjoy spending time with my family, working out, jumping on the trampoline, and jumping rope."

  bio: "My priorities in life never change at the top. I love my wife and kids more than anything in the world, but we all need a little break from reality sometimes. Gaming occupies this space for me on most nights. I can think of no better way to spend an evening when my family is in bed aim the guys all fire up the console for a night of games and fun!"

  bio: "I’m a dad of 3 married to my high school sweetheart. I’m 25 years old. Dads Gaming has saved me for boring hours of gaming solo. Thanks to them I get to play with like minded dads where family comes first and gaming comes second. I work way too many hours to enjoy gaming like I use to."

  bio: "I'm a happily married Dad of 3, a 14YO boy, a 12YO boy, and a 8 YO girl. I live in NY, about an hour and a half north of the city. When I'm not playing games I'm running the kids to their activities. We are a baseball family, both my boys do travel ball, town and school. We try to get to as many Yankee games as possible too. My daughter is into Irish Dance, she's terrible, but she still loves it! I still turn the guitar amp every once and a while and write doom/death metal riffs when the wife and kids are out of the house."

  bio: "I am a dad to one daughter (14). She is an amazing person and I am very proud of her. I have been gaming since age 6 because as a child I had severe asthma that left me unable to play sports with my friends. Gaming was an escape and continues to be so with other dads I can relate to. When I'm not gaming, I enjoy the company of my dog, Jango, vacationing with my friends and competition shooting with my dad."
