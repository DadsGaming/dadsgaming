Here we are, day number two, and Destiny Beta is no more. I have gotten accustom to launching into orbit to find where my next adventure will be, or try my hand in the fast-pace action of the Cruciable, or perhaps take a casual stroll around the Tower browsing the different vendors' wares or engaging in a spontanious (and highly addictive) mob dance. But I degress, the wonderful people at Bungie had their data and pulled the plug on the Beta so that they can work their wonders and make what seemed to be a complete game, even better.
