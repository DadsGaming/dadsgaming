This is the biggest and most anticipated update coming to the PlayStation to-date. Software update 4.5 brings the most requested features to PlayStation Owners. Here's what to expect when the update rolls out on March 9th, 2017:


### External USB 3.0 HDD support

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126304189@N08/33326616305/in/dateposted-public/" title="PS4_Ext_HDD"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3892/33326616305_6ce8de3853_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="PS4_Ext_HDD"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Immediately increase storage on your PS4 Consoles (e.g., Vanilla, Slim, Pro) by adding an external USB 3.0 Hard Disk Drive (HDD). Once connected and formatted, begin to download or easily transfer your games and other content to the new drive.


For anyone needing a low profile drive that doesn't require an extra power adapter, the Western Digital My Passport drives are perfect and very portable.

#### Custom Wallpapers

Take an amazing in-game screenshot in Horizon Zero Down or your favorite game? Use the built-in Photo Mode in Sharefactory to create your one-and-only custom wallpaper and background image on the PS4 home screen. Drop-shadows on text, and dimming options to the Function Area, will further enhance the system icons and texts on the home screen noticeably visible even if the background image selected is bright.

### Quick Menu

Quick Menu will now cover even less of your gameplay screen!

Online Friends now includes new party features that allows: new parties, inviting friends, and joining parties, all without switching to the separate Party app.

### Simplified Notification List

Notifications are presented in a singular simplified list for: Game Alerts, Downloads, Uploads, and more. Easier than ever to see your notifications all at-a-glance.

Customize your pop-up notifications that appear on your screen so you're only notified about top priorities. To enable this, go to Options, then Notifications settings to turn off certain notification types.

### PS Messages and Communities app Updates

New quick replies to your friends: “I’ll join later” or “Sorry, I can’t join,”

### Remote Play Gets Voice Chat

A new microphone icon on the Tool Bar of the Remote Play App, switches your mic on and off. This great when doing a quick game session with friends while you're away from your console. Or you want to add your party chat voices into your stream if you don't have a capture card.

### Off Console Availability

Indicates a player is logged into PSN but away from their system. The icon will resemble a mobile phone.
