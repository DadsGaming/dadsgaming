As a decades long MP veteran I don’t really need to talk shop regarding Dom, TDM, etc.  However…. Blackout (battle royale) is a whole new experience for me and probably many of you also.  So the purpose of this thread is to try and layout as much strategy and tips and tricks as we can for launch day.  I anticipate that our strategy and approach to this game will change over time as we get better, but I hope this guide can at least get us pointed in the right direction on day one. Please add your own suggestions and comments and I will update the map and info as needed.

This initial guide is based on my limited time with the beta which produced rather unimpressive stats:
- Time: 6 hr 51 min
- Level: 6
- Games:  47
- Wins: 2 (only alive for 1)
- Top 5: 11 times
- Kills: 43
- Deaths: 44

Here are the key areas to discuss:
1. Map & Drop Locations
2. Weapons
3. Perks & Equipment
4. General Tips

## Map & Drop Locations

All of the major locations have plenty of weapons.  However, dropping to those locations is an extremely risky endeavor.  If you don’t find a weapon first, your dead.  In my case, I was on the short end of the stick more times than not when playing the beta.  So the purpose of this map is to highlight possible alternative landing zones.

#### Drop Zone Map

| GREEN ZONES  |   |
|---|---|
| (A) Estates East  | Weapons can be found in the house and on the driveway, usually people land in the main estates but you might find a few others here as well.  |
| (B) Hydro West  | Plenty of weapons and gear in multiple rooms.  |
| (C) Hillside  | Each house typically has a weapon.  This was my winning location when playing close quarters duos.  |
| (D) Nuketown Bunkers  |  Even though I had heard about this, I never bothered to find it when playing the beta.  Wow… that was a mistake!  After the beta I watched some videos on this area and not only does it look really cool, but there are a TON of great weapons and gear in this spot.  I’m sure you can count on finding others landing here, but it’s worth a try as the payoff could be huge.  They key is knowing where the openings (hatches) are to the bunker. Below are the four ways to get into the bunker along with a detailed tour.  <a href="https://www.screencast.com/t/p40IgohEMuT8">Map - Bunker Hatch Locations</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_E4QxiwAA">YouTube - Gameplay Tour</a> |
|  (E) Rivertown South |  There are plenty of houses with loot south of Rivertown. |

|These look like possible good drop locations.  Anybody drop here during the beta?  Other potential spots?

##### Landing Tips and Tricks

I came across this video today which does a good job of showing you how to drop properly. No wonder I was getting to spots later than others as I was waiting until the helicopter was nearly directly above the spot I wanted to land before jumping.

## General Tips

1. On initial drop, if possible steer clear of any structures that have several other parachutes landing near them.  While you may be tempted to land there in hopes of getting quick kills, if you aren’t the first guy to find a gun you are SCREWED!

2. After you land, find a gun IMMEDIATELY!  I died at least 3-4 times when I couldn’t find a gun before the other guys in the building.  I spent too much time picking up all the other stuff along the way instead of strictly looking for a gun.  

3. Get comfortable with the nerve racking nature of this game type.  As somebody who is used to respawns, only having one life really gets my blood pumping as the match progresses.  So we need to stay calm and keep relaxed.

4. Become proficient with the inventory navigation and how/when to use perks.  This will apply to everyone of course, but I feel this is definitely a key area to master.  Knowing when and where to use certain perks and equipment will be the difference between winning and losing in this game.
